# A Study of Phase Distortion Synthesis

Welcome to the thesis (currently WIP) describing Phantom and its design, implementation, and more. Here I include descriptions of its various audio components accompanied by code snippets, and other visuals to help bring to light how phase distortion all works. 

## Todo

- [ ] Write the thesis outline 
- [ ] Make table of contents from outline
- [ ] Create better (and more academic) title
